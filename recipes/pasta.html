        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>Pasta is delicious. If you have never had you need to close your browser, get away from your device, go to the nearest Italian restaurant, and have yourself a bowl of delicious grains smushed into funny shapes. What it lacks in nutritional value it makes up for versatility.</p>

        <p>Please note, fair reader, that boiling water is used in this recipe. Boiling water is hot, and so is the stovetop that we'll be using to heat the water. If you attempt this recipe, it is with the understanding that whatever injuries may befall you are purely your own fault and responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>pre-packaged dry pasta (what, did you think we were gonna make it from scratch?)</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>ten minutes, which is why this is THE dish for students and professionals alike</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot, fill it with water, and put it on the stovetop on high heat.</li>
            <li>Lightly salt the water, which will help the starches in the pasta from sticking together and making a gummy mess during the boiling process.</li>
            <li>Uh, I guess look at the instructions on the pre-packaged dry pasta . . . that way you'll know how long to cook it and such.</li>
            <li>Probably strain the pasta, unless you're making a "one pot" dish.</li>
        </ol>
